# DICOMSliceViewer
This folder contains the MATLAB code that I have previously written to develop a  
GUI in MATALB to aid the visualisation and analysis of DICOM medical images through  
performing coordinate transformations and planar-reslicing.

The GUI is able to access and process medical image DICOM data from a parsed   
repository, or the location of the DICOM directory may be selected within the  
GUI. All of the image processing tasks have been divided into individual functions,  
and test scripts have been provided to demonstrate correct operation of these  
functions. Cases where invalid user input may generate an error are recognised,  
and where possible, handled appropriately.

Please see Written_Report.pdf for more details regarding the full functionality  
of the GUI.
